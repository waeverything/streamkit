# WAE's Discord Widget for streaming

**Widget url:** https://waeverything.github.io/streamkit/widgets/discord2

<br>

## Using widget with OBS
- Add new browser source
- Set resolution to be the same as your stream (eg. 1920x1080)
- Use same FPS as your stream (eg. 60fps)

***

## How to use multiple properties (url parameters)
Here is a example url with multiple properties: https://waeverything.github.io/streamkit/widgets/discord2?position=right&size=20

You can seperate properties using the `&` character, remember to include the `?` character in the url before the first parameter.

***

## Widget position
The widget will default to the upper left corner of the window. If you want it to be on the right side just add `?position=right` to the end of the url like shown below.

## Widget size
You can change the widget size by adding `?size=16` to the end of the url. Default font size is 16.
